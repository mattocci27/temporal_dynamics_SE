#### [abund_1976_2006.png](https://github.com/mattocci27/temporal_dynamics_SE/blob/master/figs/abund_1976_2006.png)
Scatterplot of relative abundance changes versus each trait. The relative abundance changes of each species were calculated as the number of individuals in the 2006 census plus one dividing by the number of individuals in the 1976 census plus one for the 0.04-ha subplots. The black points represent species mean values. Dashed lines indicate equal abundance in 1976 and 2006.

Scatterplot of relative abundance changes versus each trait. The relative abundance changes of each species were calculated as the number of individuals in the 2006 census dividing by the number of individuals in the 1976 census for the 0.04-ha subplots. The black points represent species mean values. Dashed lines indicate equal abundance in 1976 and 2006.

#### [abund_1976_1996.png](https://github.com/mattocci27/temporal_dynamics_SE/blob/master/figs/abund_1976_1996.png)
Scatterplot of relative abundance changes versus each trait. The relative abundance changes of each species were calculated as the number of individuals in the 1996 census dividing by the number of individuals in the 1976 census for the 0.04-ha subplots. The black points represent species mean values. Dashed lines indicate equal abundance in 1976 and 1996.

Scatterplot of relative abundance changes versus each trait. The relative abundance changes of each species were calculated as the number of individuals in the 1996 census plus one dividing by the number of individuals in the 1976 census plus one for the 0.04-ha subplots. The black points represent species mean values. Dashed lines indicate equal abundance in 1976 and 1996.
#### [com_trends_additive.png](https://github.com/mattocci27/temporal_dynamics_SE/blob/master/figs/com_trends_addtive.png)
Temporal trends of community weighted mean traits from 1976 to 2006 for 0.04ha subplots. Each symbol represents a census by subplot combination. Same subplots were connected by line for readability. Note that no statstical models were applied.

#### [com_trends_all.png](https://github.com/mattocci27/temporal_dynamics_SE/blob/master/figs/com_trends_all.png)
Temporal trends of community weighted mean traits from 1976 to 2006 for the entire plot. Each symbol represents a census by plot combination. Same data were connected by line for readability. Note that no statstical models were applied.

#### [kerenel_density.png](https://github.com/mattocci27/temporal_dynamics_SE/blob/master/figs/kernel_density.png)
Kernel density estimates for each trait. Kernel density estimates are community weighted mean trait values for 0.04-ha subplots. The three colors represent three censuses conducted between 1976 and 2006.
